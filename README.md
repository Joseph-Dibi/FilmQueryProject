Films can be searched by ID, or Keyword. Searching a film by keyword uses a query with LIKE that searches for any instance of the word (or letters) in any part of the title or description. The search will then return a list of the films along with basic information about the movie and actors.

Movies searched by ID will display that single movie's information as well as an option to view more info. If you choose to view more info you will see the cast and categories along with other semi relevant information. You can also look up the availability of the movie from there. This displays either all copies or copies from a specific store.
